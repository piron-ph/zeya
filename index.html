        I've been lying here and i'm wide awake,
        <br>
    im waiting till the night dies out and the day to break.
    <br>
    While you were asleep as i am writing this,
    <br> 
    i kept thinking about you and it makes me smile.
    <br>
    <br>
    While every hour feels like a minute, 
    <br>
    I find myself falling for you more with each passing time.
    <br>
    How could it be? You've already become
    <br>
    One of the best things that ever happened to me
