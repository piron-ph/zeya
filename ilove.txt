HOW EVERY TIME THAT I TALK TO YOU I FEEL SAFE AND RELAXED.

SHARING YOU EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE
THE WAY THE NECKLACE I GAVE YOU FITS YOU. 
YOUR SMILE AND THE WAY IT MAKES ME SHIVERS; A GOOSEBUMPS.
YOUR EYES, HOW I CAN STARE AT THEM LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW MUCH I WANT TO SPEND ALL MY TIME WITH YOU.
EVERY SMALL THINGS THAT YOU DO. HOW IT FILLS EVERYTHING UP, AND MAKING EVERYTHING AS PERFECT AS YOU ARE.
THE WAY I MAKE YOU SMILE
YOUR FACE
YOUR ATTITUDE, THE MALDITA VIBES YOU GIVE JUST BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO
YOUR LIPS, THE WAY I BADLY WANT TO KISS THEM
THE WAY YOU GET JELOUS OVER LITTLE THINGS
HOW YOU CAN MAKE ME SHUT UP JUST BY WATCHING YOU OR LOOKING AT YOU
